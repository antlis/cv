## [1.5.4] — 2026-06-12

### Added
- Click-to-zoom lightbox for case-study images — clicking any Deep Dive image opens it fullscreen; close via backdrop click, close button or Escape
- SEO: `sitemap.xml` (via `@astrojs/sitemap`, covers all profile × language routes) and `robots.txt` pointing to it

### Added
- `merge.mjs` validates the profile `slug === spec` invariant and fails fast with a clear message, preventing silent desync between a profile's URL and its CV/download files

### Changed
- Tags de-emphasized — removed borders and muted text on Platforms/Stack/Tags pills so the identical-looking groups stop competing for attention and section hierarchy reads clearer (lead designer feedback)
- CI: Telegram notification now passes secrets and context through an `env` block instead of inline `${{ }}` interpolation in the shell script
- CI: GitHub Actions runner upgraded to Node 24
- CI: PDF export now drives the runner's preinstalled Google Chrome (`channel: 'chrome'`) instead of downloading Playwright's chromium — removes the `cdn.playwright.dev` download that was stalling and hanging deploys; the Playwright browser-cache step was dropped. Local builds still use Playwright's bundled chromium
- Responsive breakpoints consolidated from seven ad-hoc values to two — `768px` (desktop/mobile base: header, fonts, paddings, animated background) and `960px` (multi-column CV and showcase grids); mobile container side padding tightened

### Removed
- Dead code in the dynamic showcase route — unused featured/regular/archived split, leftover CSS classes and a stray `...` token in the card markup

### Fixed
- Removed hover-lift from passive cards (Experience and others) — the global `.card:hover` translate/shadow was a false affordance on non-clickable cards; hover now stays only on interactive showcase project cards (lead designer feedback)
- AnimatedBackground performance — reduced orb blur (80px → 60px), slowed drift cycles to 16–22s and removed `scale()` from keyframes so the blurred layer is cached instead of re-rasterized every frame; cuts desktop scroll/idle jank
- Showcase LCP — first card with an actual image cover now loads `eager` with `fetchpriority="high"`; remaining covers stay lazy
- Role dropdown accessibility — added `aria-haspopup`, `aria-controls` and `aria-expanded` synced with open state; removed a stray always-true `active` class on the trigger
- i18n: showcase card labels (Platforms/Stack/Tags/Featured) on non-default-language lists no longer fall back to English literals — a stray `[lang]` index on an already-resolved string was dropping the real translations; now correctly localized and ready for additional languages
- Build robustness: home page now guards a missing merged CV artifact with a fallback instead of crashing the build (matches the dynamic profile route)
- Mobile header — the Role dropdown button rendered larger than the nav links (16px vs 14px, wider padding) because a later `.dropdown__trigger { font: inherit }` overrode the mobile rule; the mobile rule's specificity was raised so the button now matches the links

## [1.5.3] — 2026-04-26

### Added
- `PlayStationWaves.astro` — XMB-inspired filled sine-wave canvas background; configurable via props (wave count, speed, amplitude, color, opacity, background gradient, draw quality); time-of-day hue shift; non-deterministic start via `Date.now()` offset
- `WaveLines.astro` — XMB-style glowing stroke wave lines canvas background; symmetric line arrangement around center Y; per-line glow via offscreen canvas compositing; same prop/config system
- GitHub Actions Telegram notification — `deploy.yml` notifies a Telegram bot on deploy success/failure via `PIPLINE_BOT_SECRET` and `CHAT_ID` secrets; gracefully skips if secrets are not configured
- CI: Playwright Chromium cached by `package-lock.json` hash — saves ~2 min per deploy on cache hit
- `LICENSE` — MIT license added to repository
- `ARCHITECTURE.md` — root-level architecture overview: stack, data pipeline, routing, theming, background components, CI/CD, key trade-offs
- `CHANGELOG.md` — this file; root-level changelog in Keep a Changelog format covering full version history from 1.0.0

### Fixed
- `WaveLines` glow compositing bug — original `destination-in` mask was applied to the full canvas each iteration, progressively destroying background alpha at edges; fixed by isolating each line's glow on a dedicated offscreen canvas
- Telegram notification now covers build failures — `notify_telegram` uses `needs: [build, deploy]` with `if: always()` so a failed build also triggers notification; message extended with branch name and short commit SHA
- Sticky header now works unconditionally — `html, body { height: 100% }` constrained body to viewport height, causing scroll to happen on `<html>` and making `position: sticky` ineffective; changed to `html { height: 100% }` / `body { min-height: 100% }`
- Role dropdown — replaced CSS `:hover` toggle with JS click-toggle and click-outside to close; menu no longer closes on accidental cursor exit; added smooth opacity/transform transition
- Scroll jank — body `background-attachment: fixed` replaced with a fixed pseudo-element layer; gradients no longer repaint on every scroll frame
- Removed `mix-blend-mode: overlay` from the scanline noise layer — eliminated a fullscreen compositing pass per frame with no visible difference at 0.06 opacity

---

## [1.5.1] — 2026-04-02

### Fixed
- Language switcher on Showcase list now correctly switches language instead of redirecting to home
- Language switcher on Case Study pages now correctly switches language of the current project

- Showcase slug setup for other languages was incorrect for projects with `archived` and `featured` flags

---
